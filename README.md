# 🐇 Welcome to Killawabbit's GitHub! ⚔️

## About Me
Hi! I'm **Killawabbit**, a curious tech enthusiast and a history buff with a passion for storytelling and creative problem-solving.

## Why killawabbit?
If you're interested, my alias draws inspiration from multiple sources of comedy, history, and technology:

🎥 **Monty Python and the Holy Grail**: Like the "killer rabbit," my work often combines unexpected strength and ingenuity, tackling challenges with humor and efficiency.

🐰 **Elmer Fudd's "Kill the Wabbit"**: A playful nod to the classic Looney Tunes, reflecting my lighthearted approach to solving complex problems.

📜 **Medieval Marginalia**: Inspired by whimsical depictions of rabbits overpowering knights in illuminated manuscripts, I embrace creativity, surprise, and a historical twist in both my work and hobbies.
