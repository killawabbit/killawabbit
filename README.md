# Welcome to Killawabbit's GitHub! 🐇⚔️

## About Me
Hi! I'm **Killawabbit**, a curious tech enthusiast and a history buff with a passion for storytelling and creative problem-solving. 

##What's s killawabbit?
If you're interested, my alias draws inspiration from multiple sources of comedy, history, and technology:

- 🎥 **Monty Python and the Holy Grail**: Like the "killer rabbit," my work often combines unexpected strength and ingenuity, tackling challenges with humor and efficiency.
- 🐰 **Elmer Fudd's "Kill the Wabbit"**: A playful nod to the classic Looney Tunes, reflecting my lighthearted approach to solving complex problems.
- 📜 **Medieval Marginalia**: Inspired by whimsical depictions of rabbits overpowering knights in illuminated manuscripts, I embrace creativity, surprise, and a historical twist in both my work and hobbies.

When I'm not working on tech projects, I enjoy researching history and unsolved crimes, writing scripts for podcasts that explore fascinating stories from the past.

## My Interest Areas
I’m passionate about exploring technology, creativity, and problem-solving. Here are a few areas that capture my interest:

- 🛠️ **Web development**: Continuously learning and working on my skills to build and deploy web applications.
- 🌱 **Personal growth in technology**: Experimenting with tools, workflows, and templates to improve my knowledge and efficiency.
- ⭐ **Discovering useful projects**: Starring repositories that inspire me or could be valuable for my own projects.
- 🌍 **Translations**: Translating software and tools into Swedish to better understand and adapt them.
- 🤖 **Automation and scaling**: Exploring ways to simplify and streamline processes using automation tools.

## My Philosophy
I believe in simplicity, automation, and staying focused on what matters most: **the development process itself**. By automating repetitive tasks, I create space to dive deep into creative and technical challenges. Like the mythical "killer rabbit," my work might appear unassuming, but it’s capable of tackling the toughest knights (or code challenges).
