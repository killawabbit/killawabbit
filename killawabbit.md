# Why killawabbit?

You're ready to go down the rabbit hole?

My alias draws inspiration from a mix of humor, history, and pop culture. Here are the main influences:

### 🐇 Monty Python's "Killer Rabbit"
The legendary "Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog" from *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* represents unexpected strength and ingenuity. This seemingly harmless rabbit proves to be a deadly force, much like how creativity and problem-solving can overcome the toughest challenges.

### 🎭 Elmer Fudd's "Kill the Wabbit"
This playful nod comes from Elmer Fudd's operatic performance in *What's Opera, Doc?*. His iconic line "Kill the Wabbit" highlights the absurdity and humor in his relentless pursuit of Bugs Bunny.

### 📜 Medieval Marginalia: "Killer Rabbits"
Inspired by whimsical illustrations from medieval manuscripts, these "killer rabbits" often appear defeating knights and hunters, turning the expected power dynamics upside down. They reflect the humor and creativity of the medieval imagination.

## BTW
Yes, it's also a small nod to the line **"Follow the white rabbit"** from one of my favorite movies, [*The Matrix*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix), which in itself references [*Alice's Adventures in Wonderland*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland). But I felt it was beginning to be too meta — and if you're anything like me, you probably got that yourself...

Oh, and it just so happens that this movie premiered just one and a half months after my actual birthday, but that's just a coincidence...
