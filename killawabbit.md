# Why killawabbit?

You're ready to go down the rabbit hole?

My alias draws inspiration from a mix of humor, history, and pop culture. Here are the main influences:

### üêá Monty Python's "Killer Rabbit"
The legendary "Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog" from *Monty Python and the Holy Grail* represents unexpected strength and ingenuity. This seemingly harmless rabbit proves to be a deadly force, much like how creativity and problem-solving can overcome the toughest challenges.

### üé≠ Elmer Fudd's "Kill the Wabbit"
This playful nod comes from Elmer Fudd's operatic performance in *What's Opera, Doc?*. His iconic line "Kill the Wabbit" highlights the absurdity and humor in his relentless pursuit of Bugs Bunny.
